/**
 * Classes implementing Tasks for pre, post or error operations
 * 
 * 
 * Several kind of tasks exist in OpenR66:<br>
 * LOG, MOVE, MOVERENAME, COPY, COPYRENAME, EXEC, EXECMOVE, LINKRENAME, TRANSFER, VALIDFILEPATH,
 * DELETE<br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Several tasks are possible to run before a transfer starts (pre action), after a transfer is
 * finished correctly (post action) or after an error occurs (either in pre or post action or during
 * transfer: error action).
 * 
 * Those actions are defined in one rule. Each rule contains 2 parts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sender actions: A host is a Sender if it is the requester on a SEND rule or if it is the
 * requested on a RECV rule.</li>
 * <li>Receiver actions: A host is a Sender if it is the requester on a RECV rule or if it is the
 * requested on a SEND rule.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Each action could be on pre, post or error step, each step can have several actions.
 * 
 * It is defined with a unified form of XML:<br>
 * <xmp> <tasks> <task> <type>NAME</type> <path>path</path> <delay>x</delay> </task> <task>
 * <type>NAME</type> <path>path</path> <delay>x</delay> </task> </tasks></xmp><br>
 * Where
 * <ul>
 * <li>Type is the type of task to execute (see below the supported types)</li>
 * <li>Path is a fixed argument for the task to execute. On this argument, string replacements are
 * done when the following patterns are found:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#TRUEFULLPATH# : Current full path of current FILENAME</li>
 * <li>#TRUEFILENAME# : Current FILENAME (basename) (change in retrieval part)</li>
 * <li>#ORIGINALFULLPATH# : Original full path FILENAME (before changing in retrieval part)</li>
 * <li>#ORIGINALFILENAME# : Original FILENAME (basename) (before changing in retrieval part)</li>
 * <li>#FILESIZE# : File size if it exists</li>
 * <li>#INPATH# : In (Receive) path</li>
 * <li>#OUTPATH# : Out (Send) path</li>
 * <li>#WORKPATH# : Working (while receiving) path</li>
 * <li>#ARCHPATH# : Archive path (for export Log)</li>
 * <li>#HOMEPATH# : Home path (to enable for instance relative path commands)</li>
 * <li>#RULE# : Rule used during transfer</li>
 * <li>#DATE# : Current Date in yyyyMMdd format</li>
 * <li>#HOUR# : Current Hour in HHmmss format</li>
 * <li>#REMOTEHOST# : Remote host Id (if not the initiator of the call)</li>
 * <li>#LOCALHOST# : Local host Id</li>
 * <li>#TRANSFERID# : Transfer Id</li>
 * <li>#REQUESTERHOST# : Requester host Id</li>
 * <li>#REQUESTEDHOST# : Requested host Id</li>
 * <li>#FULLTRANSFERID# : Full Transfer Id as TRANSFERID_REQUESTERHOST_REQUESTEDHOST</li>
 * <li>#RANKTRANSFER# : Current or final RANK of block</li>
 * <li>#BLOCKSIZE# : Block size used</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Delay is generally the delay (if any) for execution before the execution becomes out of time.
 * </li>
 * <li>Additionnaly, a task will use also the argument from the transfer itself (Transfer
 * Information).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * 
 * The different kinds of TASK are:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>LOG</li> This task logs or writes to an external file some info:<br>
 * - if delay is 0, no echo at all will be done<br>
 * - if delay is 1, will echo some information in the normal log<br>
 * - if delay is 2, will echo some information in the file (last deduced argument will be the full
 * path for the file output)<br>
 * - if delay is 3, will echo both in the normal log and in the file (last deduced argument will be
 * the full path for the file output)
 * <li>MOVE</li> Move the file to the path designed by Path and Transfer Information arguments
 * without renaming the filename (same basename). Delay is ignored. The file is marked as moved.
 * <li>MOVERENAME</li> Move the file to the path designed by Path and Transfer Information
 * arguments. Delay is ignored. After Path is transformed according to above dynamic replacements,
 * it is then used as a String Format where Transfer Information is used as input
 * (String.format(Path,Info)). The file is marked as moved.
 * <li>COPY</li> Copy the file to the path designed by Path argument without renaming the filename
 * (same basename). Delay and Transfer Information are ignored. The file is not marked as moved.
 * <li>COPYRENAME</li> Copy the file to the path designed by Path and Transfer Information
 * arguments. Delay is ignored. After Path is transformed according to above dynamic replacements,
 * it is then used as a String Format where Transfer Information is used as input
 * (String.format(Path,Info)). The file is not marked as moved.
 * <li>EXEC</li> Execute an external command given by Path and Transfer Information arguments. The
 * Delay is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds before the task should be considered as over
 * time and so in error.<br>
 * The command path is obtained from Path transformed according to above dynamic replacements, and
 * after a String Format where Transfer Information is used as input (String.format(Path,Info)).
 * <li>EXECMOVE</li> Execute an external command given by Path and Transfer Information arguments.
 * The Delay is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds before the task should be considered as
 * over time and so in error.<br>
 * The command path is obtained from Path transformed according to above dynamic replacements, and
 * after a String Format where Transfer Information is used as input (String.format(Path,Info)).<br>
 * The last line returned by the external command is interpreted as the new full file path. The
 * external command is responsible to really move the previous file to the new one. The file is
 * marked as moved.
 * <li>TRANSFER</li> Submit a new transfer based on the Path and Transfer Information arguments. The
 * transfer arguments are obtained from Path transformed according to above dynamic replacements,
 * and after a String Format where Transfer Information is used as input (String.format(Path,Info)).
 * The result should be as r66send except that "-info" must be the last entry:<br>
 * "-file filepath -to requestedHost -rule rule [-md5] -info transferInformation" where each field
 * is separated by blank character. Last field (transferInformation) may contain however blank
 * character. Delay is ignored. The file is not marked as moved.
 * <li>VALIDFILEPATH</li> Test if the current file is under one of the paths based on the Path and
 * Transfer Information arguments. The paths arguments are obtained from Path transformed according
 * to above dynamic replacements, and after a String Format where Transfer Information is used as
 * input (String.format(Path,Info)). The result should be as: "path1 path2 ..." where each path is
 * separated by blank character. If Delay is not 0, a log is printed out. The file is not marked as
 * moved.
 * <li>DELETE</li> This task deletes the current file.The current file is no more valid. No
 * arguments are taken into account.
 * <li>LINKRENAME</li> Create a link of the current file and make the file pointing to it. The link
 * first tries to be a hard link, then a soft link, and if it is really not possible (not supported
 * by the filesystem), it does a copy and rename task.<br>
 * Delay is ignored. After Path is transformed according to above dynamic replacements, it is then
 * used as a String Format where Transfer Information is used as input (String.format(Path,Info)).
 * The file is not marked as moved.
 * </ul>
